                Hi there, my name is Chuong Vo, I'm currently working as a Senior IT Support Role and decided to move into Software Developing. I love programming/coding and 
                create new design, and I believe going into programming would help me do the things that I love to do. I created 5 websites to showcase my experience, knowledge and creativity.
